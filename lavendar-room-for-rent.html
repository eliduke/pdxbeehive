<h3>Room for Rent!</h3>
<p>We've got a month-to-month room available on September 1st at the PDX Beehive in NE Portland (51st and Killingsworth). Maybe you're in a tight spot and you need a place to crash for a couple months? Awesome. Maybe you are in-between some travels and need a place in Portland for the fall/winter? Totally cool. Or maybe you're pumped about a sweet, long-term place! All of that sounds great to us, but we will probably give preference to those that want a longer stay.</p>

<h3>The Quick and Dirty</h3>
<ul>
  <li>AVAILABLE SEPTEMBER 1st</li>
  <li>$500/MONTH RENT</li>
  <li>$150/MONTH ALL UTILITIES &amp; RESERVED PARKING SPOT</li>
  <li>$500 DEPOSIT</li>
  <li>NO COUPLES (because we've got 4 bedrooms sharing 1 bathroom)</li>
  <li>NO PETS</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Room</h3>
<p>The Lavender Room (10.5' x 9.5') is on the ground floor on the north side of the house. It has one brand new window, a good sized closet, wall-mounted electric heater, new carpet, and is nestled between the breakfast nook and the Charcoal Room (the other rental room). Due to it's proximaty to the kitchen, this room is not well-suited for light sleepers. Along with the room itself, you also get a dedicated lockable spot in the bike shed and storage shelves in the basement.</p>
