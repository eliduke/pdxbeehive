      <p>The heat is two-fold: a gas furnace in the basement and wall-mounted electric heaters in each of the bedrooms.</p>
      <h3>Gas Furnace</h3>
      <p>The gas furnace is controlled by the Nest thermostat in the living room.</p>

      <p>When you first walk up to the Nest, it will probably show you the time. Push lightly anywhere on the device to bring up the current temperature / heating status in the house. The picture above is showing you two different scenarios. On the left it shows that the temperature inside the house is 66 degrees and the Nest is set at 66 degrees, so the heat is off. On the right it shows that the temperature inside the house is 65 degrees and the Nest is set at 68 degrees, so the heat is on! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Turning the Nest to the right or left will raise or lower the temperature, respectively.</p>
      <p>The good news is that you shouldn't need to adjust the temperature in the house very often because we have a super sweet heating schedule already in place.</p>

      <p>Weekday mornings the furnace kicks on around 5:30am and brings the heat in the house all the way up to 66 degrees, and it stays there until 8am when it comes back down to 58. It holds at 58 degrees all day until 4:30pm when it goes back up to 66 for the evening hours. The schedule is a best-guess for comfort and efficiency, but it depends on the combination of all of our schedules. If there is any part of it you'd like to change or adjust, definitely let us know.</p>
      <p>In general we don't schedule the furnace heat very high because 1) it's hard to know exactly when people will be home to actually use the warmth, 2) it's winter time and it's reasonable to wear a sweater, and 3) you have a heater in your room that you can set however you like (more on that later).</p>
      <p>However, if you're ever chilling at home and watching a movie in the living room or eating dinner in the kitchen and it's just too darn cold, don't hesitate to zip over to the Nest and turn it up a bit. No problem. Once you've turned it up, the Nest will show you how long it will stay at that temp, which is an important detail. For example:</p>
      <p>
        <blockquote>
          If it's 8pm on a Tuesday and you turn the heat up to 68 degrees, the Nest will tell you that it will stay there until 11pm, the next scheduled change in temp. If you turn the heat up to 68 degrees at 11:30pm, the next will tell you that it will stay there until 5:30am the next morning! The heat would stay at 68 degrees all through the night, and we probably don't need that.
        </blockquote>

      <h3>Electric Heaters</h3>
      <p>The wall-mounted electric heaters are <em>much more</em> self explanatory. There's an on button and a temperature dial. They are a slow heat, which means they take about an hour to really get going, but they are also much more efficient than lots of other electric heaters out there.</p>
      <p>A couple things to keep in mind: 1) keep your door closed when you have the heater on and 2) remember to turn the heater off when you leave the house. We have found that a good pattern to follow can be to turn the heater on when you get home in the evening and then turn it off when you go to bed. The built-up heat in the room will last until you're asleep and all warm and toasty under the covers and then the house heat will kick on in the morning.</p>
      <h3>But of course...</h3>
      <p>We want you to be comfortable! So do what you need to do. We just don't want to burn what we're not using, and if something still feels off, please let us know so that we can help figure it out.</p>
