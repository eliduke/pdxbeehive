<h2 class="text-center">Furnished Room for Rent!</h2>

<p>We've got a month-to-month, furnished room available starting <strong>October 1st</strong> at The Beehive in NE Portland / Cully neighborhood (near NE 52nd and Killingsworth St). Maybe you're in a tight spot and you need a place to crash for a couple months? Awesome. Maybe you're in-between some travels and need a place in Portland for the fall/winter? Totally cool. Or, maybe you're pumped about a sweet, long-term place! All of that sounds great to us, but we will probably give preference to those that want a longer stay.</p>

<h3>The Charcoal Room</h3>

<img class="img-rounded img-responsive charcoal-hero" src="/images/rentals/charcoal-room/charcoal-room-1.jpg" />

<p>The Charcoal Room (named for its accent wall) is on the ground floor in the northwest corner of the house. It has two newer windows facing west and north, a good-sized closet, a wall-mounted electric heater, new-ish carpet, blackout curtains, and is nestled between the bathroom and the Lavendar Room (the other rental room on the ground floor). Due to it's proximaty to the bathroom, you will probably hear some muffled showers being taken and toilets being flushed, so it's not great for <em>super</em> light sleepers.</p>

<p id="1">&sup1; <strong>RENT</strong> includes a dedicated off-street parking spot, a lockable spot in the bike shed, some storage shelves in the basement, and the room furnishings: a full-size bed, foldable metal frame/platform, nightstand, small dresser, and small bureau shelf thing.</p>
