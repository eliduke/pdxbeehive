<h2 class="text-center">ROOM FOR RENT</h2>

<p>We've got a month-to-month, furnished room available starting <strong>April 1st</strong> at The Beehive in NE Portland / Cully neighborhood (near NE 52nd and Killingsworth St).</p>

<div class='coronavirus'>
  <h3 class="text-center"><em><strong>COVID-19 CAVEAT</strong></em></h3>
  <p><em>One of our longer-term tenants is forced to move back home to Canada during the COVID-19 crisis to be closer to family, so this is a last-minute sort of thing. Our normal breakdown of rent and utilities is listed below for those of you that have a job and can still afford it. But we all know that times are tough right now, and we are open to lots of different options. If someone is in desperate need of housing, has lost their job, or is just struggling financially because of the coronavirus, we are open to discussions about discounted or possibly even free rent for a while as things continue to shake out.</em></p>

<h3>The Charcoal Room</h3>

<img class="img-rounded img-responsive charcoal-hero" src="/images/rentals/charcoal-room/charcoal-room-1.jpg" />

<p>The Charcoal Room (named for its accent wall) is on the ground floor in the northwest corner of the house. It has two newer windows facing west and north, a good-sized closet, a wall-mounted electric heater, new-ish carpet, and blackout curtains. It is nestled between the bathroom and the Lavendar Room (the other rental room on the ground floor). Due to it's proximaty to the bathroom, you will probably hear some muffled showers being taken and toilets being flushed, so it's not great for <em>super</em> light sleepers.</p>

<p id="1"><sup>1</sup> <strong>RENT</strong> includes a dedicated off-street parking spot, a lockable spot in the bike shed, some storage shelves in the basement, and the room furnishings: a full-size bed, foldable metal frame/platform, nightstand, small dresser, and small bureau shelf thing.</p>
