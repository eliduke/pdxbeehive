<h2 class="text-center">Furnished Room for Rent!</h2>

<p>We've got a month-to-month room available <strong>October 1st</strong> at The Beehive in NE Portland / Cully neighborhood (near NE 52nd and Killingsworth St). Maybe you're in a tight spot and you need a place to crash for a couple months? Awesome. Maybe you are in-between some travels and need a place in Portland for the fall/winter? Totally cool. Or maybe you're pumped about a sweet, long-term place! All of that sounds great to us, but we will probably give preference to those that want a longer stay.</p>

<h3>The Charcoal Room</h3>

<p>The Charcoal Room (10.5' x 9.5') is on the ground floor on the north side of the house. It has two new windows (west and north facing), a good sized closet, wall-mounted electric heater, new-ish carpet, and is nestled between the bathroom and the Lavendar Room (the other rental room on the ground floor). Due to it's proximaty to the bathroom, you will hear some muffled showers being taken and toilets being flushed, so it's not <em>great</em> for <em>super</em> light sleepers. Along with the room itself, you get a dedicated off-street parking spot, a lockable spot in the bike shed, and storage shelves in the basement.</p>

<p id="1">&sup1; <strong>ALL UTILITIES</strong> includes water, electric, gas, internet, and cleaning products (dish soap, spunges, paper towels, windex, toilet paper, laundry detergent, etc).</p>
