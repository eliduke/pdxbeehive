<h3 class="text-center">Furnished Room for Rent!</h3>

<p>We've got a month-to-month room available <strong>January 1st</strong> at The Beehive in NE Portland (near 52nd and Killingsworth St). Maybe you're in a tight spot and you need a place to crash for a couple months? Awesome. Maybe you are in-between some travels and need a place in Portland for the summer? Totally cool. Or maybe you're pumped about a sweet, long-term place! All of that sounds great to us, but we will probably give preference to those that want a longer stay.</p>
