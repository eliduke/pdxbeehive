notes: This movie came out over 10 years ago and it still hasn't garnered the acclaim that it probably should. It's animated beautifully (with that sweet claymation style), the story is super solid (thanks to Dan Harmon), and it <em>actually</em> gets a little scary at times for a "kids" movie. It's gonna be the perfect kindling to get the Halloween fire started! Also, when the movie is over, we're gonna wrap up everything real quick and head over to <strong>The Spare Room</strong> to shake our booties with <strong>The Hustle</strong> ($5 cover).
