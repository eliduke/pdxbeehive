notes: THE IRON GIANT is still one of the best animated movies of all time. Fact. But seriously, it's hilarious and genuine and beautifully animated, not to mention the super sweet positive message that flows through from start to finish. If you haven't seen Iron Giant before, DO NOT miss it. If you have, you're gonna wanna see it again.
