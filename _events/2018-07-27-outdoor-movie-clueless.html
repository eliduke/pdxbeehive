notes: This movie came out in 1995 and somehow it's <em>still</em> just as relevant and hilarious today, over 20 years later. That's the true sign of a classic. I mean, just the other day I was rolling with my homies and I'm sure you were too. Also, when the movie is over, we're gonna wrap up everything <em>real quick</em> and then roll over to <strong>The Spare Room</strong> to shake our booties with <strong>The Get Down</strong> ($10 cover).
